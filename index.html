        <p>I'm Bohdan Lavrentiev. I'm a Front-End developer from Ukraine, who learns always something new, and who also likes motivate, creates content. I realy like program, work with program languages, play volleyball, travel and discover new places. Roughly in begin of the February 2022 I found and started a course "30DaysOfJavaScript" from the great teacher, motivator and content creator Asabeneh Yetayeh. It should take 30 days, but the war between Ukraine and Russia began and I can't continue the learn process due no electricity in my Mariupol city. After some months I succesfully escaped from the hell and continued the work. Sometimes I needed stop the procces, because I looked for a silence place where I could continue my normal life. So, when was in trip I didn't learn, because I was quite busy at those time. But, when I came to the Switzerland I decided I can continue and finish the great course. Here is day 27 of 30 JavaScript challenge.</p>
